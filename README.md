# Tennis Decision Prediction – Regression and Backward Elimination

This project aims to predict whether to play tennis based on weather conditions using a linear regression model and feature selection via backward elimination. It is implemented in Python with the help of `pandas`, `scikit-learn`, and `statsmodels`.

## 🔍 Project Overview

The dataset includes features such as:
- `outlook` (e.g., sunny, overcast, rainy)
- `temperature`
- `humidity`
- `windy` (TRUE/FALSE)
- `play` (whether tennis was played: yes/no)

### The main steps in the project:
- Load and preprocess the data
- Convert categorical variables using One-Hot Encoding
- Split the dataset into training and testing sets
- Train a linear regression model
- Apply backward elimination to select statistically significant features

## 🧪 Technologies Used

- Python
- pandas
- scikit-learn
- statsmodels
